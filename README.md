# 🧑‍💻 7-Day Web Development Course

Welcome to the official repository of my **7-Day Web Development Bootcamp**, where I had the privilege of teaching a wonderful group of students the foundational pillars of web development — **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

This course was designed to be beginner-friendly and hands-on, focusing on building real-world skills from the ground up. Each day covered new concepts with practical examples, and it was truly a rewarding journey for both me and my students.
